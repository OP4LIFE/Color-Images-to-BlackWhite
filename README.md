# Color-Images-to-Black-White
This Python script helps to automate conversion of a large number of RGB images to black and white images by running this script inside the folder which contains images.

# Requirements:
This script uses one external library of python-'Pillow'. This library can be installed by using pip as 'pip install Pillow' or it can also be installed by running the file 'requirements.py' available in this repository.

# Using the Script:
- Just place the script inside the images containing folder (ie. keep the python file 'getbw.py' along with the images which are to be converted) and run 'python getbw.py'.

- This script then creates a new folder by the name 'BlackWhite' and inside it, it keeps all the converted black and white images.
